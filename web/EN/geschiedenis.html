        HOW IT BEGUN
      </h3>
      <p>
        On Nov 19, 1798,
        the government decided to set up a national museum following the French example.
        A 'prestige project' to stimulate the love for the country but also to preserve important objects.
        On May 31, 1800, this National Art Gallery opened its doors for the first time in Huis Ten Bosch in The Hague.
        With over 200 paintings and historical objects,
        partly from the stadholder's collections and partly from (discontinued) national institutions,
        like the VOC. The first purchase, De Zwaan by Jan Asselijn,
        cost 100 guilders and is still one of the highlights of the Rijksmuseum.
      </p>
      <h3>
        THE 'ROYAL MUSEUM'
      </h3>
      <p>
        In 1808 Lodewijk Napoleon was at the helm of the Kingdom of Holland.
        He moved the collections to Amsterdam, the new capital.
        And not to just any building, but to the Royal Palace on Dam Square,
        the former Amsterdam city hall.
        There they were brought together with the most important paintings of the city,
        including Rembrandt's Night Watch.
        In 1809 the Royal Museum opened on the top floor of the palace.
      </p>
      <h3>
        THE 'RIJKSMUSEUM'
      </h3>
      <p>
        With Willem I as new king from 1813,
        the museum moved as 'Rijks Museum' together with the national print collection from The Hague to the
        trip home,
        a 17th-century city palace on the Kloveniersburgwal.
        To the director's dismay, all kinds of other collections were subsequently relocated.
        Objects from classical antiquity went to a new Museum of Antiquities in Leiden and objects and
        applied arts were assigned to the Cabinet of Rarities, which had meanwhile been established in The Hague.
        In 1838 a separate museum for modern, 19th-century art was opened in Paviljoen Welgelegen in Haarlem.
        In contrast to the Napoleonic era, the Rijks Museum received only a few large works.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A NEW BUILDING
      </h3>
      <p>
        Beautiful museums were built all over Europe.
        The Netherlands also deserved a real national,
        proud museum building.
        The Trippenhuis was not suitable,
        so something new could be built.
        The architect, Pierre Cuypers,
        had made a design in historical style for the Rijksmuseum,
        a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance and full of national symbolism.
        After years of hassle - many thought it was too medieval,
        too Catholic and too little real Dutch â€“ construction started in 1876.
        It was officially opened in 1885.
        In addition to the existing collection, almost all of the older paintings of the City of Amsterdam were placed in the Rijksmuseum.
        such as Rembrandt's Jewish bride who the banker A.
        van der Hoop had left to the city.
        Art also came from Haarlem, part of the Cabinet of Rarities was given a permanent place and the print room had its own space.
        A worthy collection,
        in a beautiful building.

        <h3>
          RENOVATION ON RENOVATION
        </h3>
      <p>
        Over the years, the Rijksmuseum building has undergone a lot of work.
        For example, between 1904 and 1916, halls were built on the south-west side,
        the current Philips Wing.
        In the 1950s and 1960s, the original two courtyards were built over to create more hall space.
        After 1945, National History and Sculpture & Applied Arts were housed in separate parts of the building.
        Attempts to set up a separate museum for Dutch history and turn the Rijksmuseum into a real art museum failed.
        In the 1950s, an Asian Art department was created as a result of the housing of the collection of the Association of Friends of Asian Art. 
        The 1970s were booming,
        with almost one and a half million visitors a year.
        But the building itself was increasingly failing to meet the modern requirements for a museum.
        What now?
      </p>
      <h3>
        WE'VE COME FULL CIRCLE
      </h3>
      <p>
        During the last renovation (2003-2013), the building regained Cuypers' original structure.
        The building has been modernized, but at the same time has become more like Cuypers' building on the inside, in all its grandeur.
        Painting, crafts and history can no longer be seen in separate parts of the building.
        Everything together forms one chronological story: the story about Dutch art and history,
        from the Middle Ages to the 20th century.
        Immediately in 2013, the museum attracted a hitherto unprecedented number of visitors,
        more than two million, and that has remained so until the corona time, partly thanks to the many tourists.
        Because more than ever we strive to be the museum of and for everyone.
