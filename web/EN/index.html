            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                On Nov 19, 1798,
                the government decided to set up a national museum following the French example.
                A 'prestige project' to stimulate the love for the country but also to preserve important objects.
                On May 31, 1800, this National Art Gallery opened its doors for the first time in Huis Ten Bosch in The Hague.
                With more than 200 paintings and historical objects,
                partly from the collections of the stadtholder and partly from (discontinued) government institutions,
                like the VOC. The first purchase, De Zwaan by Jan Asselijn,
                cost 100 gulden and is still one of the highlights of the Rijksmuseum.
                
                With Willem I as new king from 1813,
                the museum moved as 'Rijks Museum' together with the national print collection from The Hague to the Trippenhuis,
                a 17th-century city palace on the Kloveniersburgwal.
                To the director's dismay, many other collections were subsequently moved.
                Objects from classical antiquity went to a new Museum of Antiquities in Leiden and objects and crafts were assigned to the Cabinet of Rarely, now established in The Hague.
                In 1838 a separate museum for modern 19th-century art was opened in Paviljoen Welgelegen in Haarlem.
                In contrast to the Napoleonic era, the Rijksmuseum received few major works.
